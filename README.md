# Usage

./run.sh 

PS: you should install python and octave or matlab in advance.

# Function

Given the input data file 'out.txt', split the data into training set and test set, use the logistic regression to predict the users' behavior, stored the actual buying behaviors in the 'actual.txt' and the predicted buying behaviors in the 'predict.txt'.

Then we present the targets hit, the Precison, the Recall and eventually, the F1 value of our models.
